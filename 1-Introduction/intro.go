// Go:

// GO is a compiled, statically typed language.
// GO tool can run file without precompiling, but in the background the application is precompiled to a temporary executable file
// Compiled files only run on a single OS unlike Java (no byte code)

// Applications built with GO have a statically linked runtime component that's packaged with the application during the compilation process.
// So the package is much larger than the source code file.
// There is no external virtual machine like Java which has an OS specific virtual machine.
// So java application compiled into byte code can be very very small but not in GO

// Is GO Object Oriented? Sort of, not really

// Sort of, can implement custom interfaces.
// Custom types have methods
// Custom structs can have member methods or member fields.

// What GO Does not support?

// There is no inheritance in GO. So no super type or no subtype
// No concept of classes ion GO either
// No method or operator overloading
// Does not have structured exception handling
// No implicit numeric conversion, so must type explicit variable types and conversions

// Related languages

// Borrows a lot from C
// Tries to reduce typing
